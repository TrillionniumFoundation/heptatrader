# Hepta research modules

Explicit C++11 data, analytics, offline replay and completed-bar strategy APIs,
plus a separately linked adapter to the existing NativeToolClient. These are
experimental developer components, not a restored HeptaDLL runtime or a
source/ABI-compatible replacement. The offline libraries also have a standalone
installable SDK; the native integration remains a separate root-build boundary.

From the repository root:

```sh
cmake -S research -B build/research -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/research --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build/research --output-on-failure
build/research/hepta-research-replay research/examples/ticks.csv research/examples/sessions.csv TEST.FUT 10 1 2 1
cmake --install build/research --prefix "$PWD/stage/research-sdk" --component ResearchSDK
```

The CSV files are synthetic. The example has no gateway address, credentials or
broker linkage and is not a profitability claim. The root build adds the native
client and real local Gateway fixture tests; standalone research does not.
Standalone CTest additionally installs, relocates and consumes the real SDK from
an external C++11 project. Root production packaging is unchanged.

See [SDK installation and consumption](PACKAGE.md),
[module contracts](../docs/modules/research-sdk.md) and the
[integration/provenance record](../docs/technical/heptadll-integration.md).
